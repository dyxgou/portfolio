  Redis revolutionized the database world by embracing a radical idea:
  <strong>complexity should exist within simplicity.</strong> This article serves
  as your entry point into that philosophy. We will reverse-engineer Redis step by
  step—starting from a simple <strong>TCP</strong> socket, implementing the Redis
  Serialization Protocol <strong>(RESP)</strong>, and finally evaluating core
  commands—all built in Golang using <strong
    >elegant, minimalist solutions.</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> 👋 This article is designed for anyone curious about how
  Redis works under the hood. Instead of overwhelming you with thousands of lines
  of code, we will focus on the essential algorithms and architectural principles
  that power this <strong>Redis clone.</strong>
