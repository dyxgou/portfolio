<Heading id="whats-a-parser"> What is a Parser? </Heading>
<p>
  <strong>Definition:</strong> Parsing is the process of structuring a linear representation
  in accordance with a given grammar.
  <br />
</p>

<p>
  WHAT? Even if this definition can sound a little complex, it is, in fact, is
  pretty simple.
  <br />
  A <strong>Linear Representation</strong> can be either a sentence of a language,
  a piece of music, or a Redis Command.
  <br />
  We have mention <strong>grammar</strong> before as the stucture of a sentence,
  or a command, think of it as a formula to get different sentences.
</p>

<p>
  So, applied to our use case, <strong>Parsing</strong> is the process of structuring
  a Redis Command in accordance with a given Command <strong>Structure</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  This is the theory, but in practice, we'll have an <strong
    >input string</strong
  > that we'll try to parse and the output will be a representation of the Redis
  Command known as an <strong>Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)</strong>.

  But still we haven't implemented anything yet, and we still don't know what is
  a <strong>Token</strong>. So...
