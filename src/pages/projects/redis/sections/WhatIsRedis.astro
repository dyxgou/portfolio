<Heading id="what-is-redis"> What and Why is Redis? </Heading>

<p>
  Before Redis, scaling applications was a paradox. As app usage soared,
  existing infrastructure crumbled under the weight of simple tasks like
  managing shopping carts, user sessions, and real-time leaderboards. These
  often relied on slow disk-bound databases and fragmented caching.
</p>
<p>
  Redis provided the breakthrough. It's a <strong>blazingly fast</strong>, <strong
    >in-memory database</strong
  > designed for simplicity: atomic operations, a clean protocol <strong
    >(RESP)</strong
  >, and pure RAM-speed access. By offloading ephemeral data like sessions and
  cached queries, Redis became the crucial enabler for systems to scale beyond
  their <strong>limits.</strong>
