<Heading id="what-is-redis"> What and Why is Redis? </Heading>

<p>
  Before Redis, scaling applications presented a significant <strong
    >bottleneck</strong
  >. As usage soared, traditional infrastructure often struggled under the
  weight of <strong>high-frequency</strong> tasks like managing shopping carts, user
  sessions, and real-time leaderboards. These systems typically relied on slow, disk-bound
  databases and inconsistent, fragmented caching layers.

<p>
  Redis provided the breakthrough. It is a <strong
    >blazingly fast, in-memory database</strong
  >
  built for simplicity: featuring atomic operations, a lightweight protocol <strong
    >(RESP)</strong
  >, and the raw speed of RAM. By offloading ephemeral data—such as sessions and
  cached queries—Redis became the essential engine allowing systems to scale
  beyond conventional <strong>limits. 🌟</strong>
